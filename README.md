# reSHsync

Store the keys for your [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/) folders in an encrypted CSV file with this simple bash script.

You can add, edit, delete and, most importantly, view.

reSHsync utilises mcrypt. If you do not have mcrypt installed it will be installed for you (*if you use Fedora*).

Read through the source before you run it in case you want to store the (encrypted) password file and CSV file in a different location than specified.
